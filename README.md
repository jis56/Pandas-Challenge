# Pandas-Challenge

As Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company, I was assigned the task of analyzing data for their newest fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. The game follows a free-to-play model, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. Utilizing Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, a report breaking down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights was created to include the following:

  1) Player Count
  2) Purchasing Analysis
  3) Gender Demographics
  4) Purchasing Analysis based off Gender
  5) Age demographics
  6) Top Spenders
  7) Most Popular Items
  8) Most Profitable Items
  
A written analysis is also included.
